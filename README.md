# BrightID-Constitution
This document outlines the responsibilities of ***[BrightID Main DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/brightid)*** and its several members in governing BrightID's open-source network ("BrightID").

## Responsibilities of BrightID Main DAO
Actions are decided by a vote of a membership and enacted by [BrightID Main DAO's software](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/brightid), including its [agent app](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/brightid/apps/).

1. Pushing code changes that affect BrightID in general
    1. Currently delegated to [members of the github organization](https://github.com/orgs/BrightID/people), who will eventually transfer control to BrightID Main DAO's agent app.
1. Deployment of a [reference app](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID) and at least one [BrightID node](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node).
    1. These functions need to be restricted to BrightID Main DAO's agent app (or automatically triggered by pushes by BrightID Main DAO's agent app).
1. Managing BrightID's cryptocurrency finances
    1. This includes directing funds from [BrightID Main DAO to sub-DAOs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F8rrUcrAIsKEVmxvfx8sLf2JyqAmtoAmfssDwZ0b2TM/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Setting the token and price used for purchasing sponsorships through the sponsorship smart contract. The initial token and price will be 1 DAI, but that will need to change due to scalability issues and inflation. The following guidelines apply.
    1. The choice of token should allow BrightID to grow to global scale.
    1. The price should be adjusted occasionally to match inflation in the greater economy.
1. Refunding income
    1. BrightID Main DAO is a non-profit organization. Income beyond what is needed to support BrightID will be redistributed equally to all sponsored BrightID users.
1. Adding or removing [members](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Constitution#membership)
1. Amending this document
    1. Currently delegated to [members of the github organization](https://github.com/orgs/BrightID/people), who will eventually transfer control to BrightID Main DAO's agent app.

## Membership
### Requirements
1. A member, by their continued membership--as evinced by their membership token, agrees to the terms of this constitution. A member may renounce their membership at any time by proposing a vote to revoke their membership token.
1. A member must be willing to devote time (without pay) to deliberating and voting on issues in the BrightID Main DAO.
1. A member must be willing to make certain personal details public.
    1. Full name
    1. Location
    1. BrightID
    1. Affiliations to other organizations
1. Affiliations to other organizations must be taken into account with regard to existing members. No group of members with a shared external affiliation should compose half or nearly half of the members. This protects the BrightID Main DAO against a takeover by an outside group.
### [Member Registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z75VFvDPQK5oFmqpQ8vE_KUkHUSKdobNCchQR-gtPec/edit?usp=sharing)
Information about members is kept in a [public registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z75VFvDPQK5oFmqpQ8vE_KUkHUSKdobNCchQR-gtPec/edit?usp=sharing). 
### No Compensation or Reward
Members are not compensated for deliberation and voting. Membership does not entitle a member to any share of assets held by the BrightID Main DAO.
